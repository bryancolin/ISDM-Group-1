# Design Thinking
he Design Thinking Methodology refers to a non-linear iterative process that teams use to understand the users, challenge the assumptions, redefine the problems, and thus, create innovative solutions that hopes to make significant improvement to individuals in society. Each phase of design thinking will be analysed closely in order to provide a better understanding on how each phase play a major role in reducing and resolving issues related to developing the Vaccine Management System (VMS). Below is a breakdown of the five phases in design thinking and how the team plans to approach building this solution: 

## 1. Empathise 
Empathising is the first step of the Design Thinking and allows for the understanding of the user’s pain points and potential improvements that will need to be developed to enhance the user experience. In order to enhance the user experience, it is important to understand the user, how they feel, and how this system will affect their way of functioning in society. A method to approach this phase requires a need to interact with the users and taking into account their viewpoint on the issue. By viewing the character profile for each of the stakeholders involved (found in the project tab), an empathy map was created to provide a visualisation on the user’s attitude and behaviour found below. This will assist the UX Team in revealing any the current user data to support a greater understanding of end users.

### General Public (Patient)
#### Point of View (POV) Statement
Patients (member of public) who are interested in getting vaccinated need to know whether they need to get vaccinated or not, as there is a lot of misleading information that is being shared and doesn't have any information to book for one.

#### Empathy Maps

#### Assumptions
- Patients have not receive any COVID-19 vaccine yet either 
- Patients will receive two doses of COVID-19 vaccine which means they will have to come back after the first vaccination within the set period of time
- Patients have no knowledge or anything regarding how to get vaccinated

## 2. Define 
After gathering user information and relevant data, it opens up a better exploration and understanding into the core problems identified by users. 
The problem definition: 
“The system to be developed needs to ensure that vaccination points are stocked according to their administering capacity (but not overstocked) and that demand on these points managed.”
With the above information, the system developers and designers are able to envision the features, functions, and other elements of the system which will assist in solving the defined problem. 

## 3. Ideate 
The ideation stage is essential to the creative development of design thinking. By utilising ideation techniques, it will allow for the expansion of the problem space and the motivation of free thinking. Through understanding of potential user pains and gains, the development team are able to look for alternative ways in viewing the problem. With the empathy map developed during the “Empathise Phase” of the design thinking process, illustrates the stakeholder’s emotions and background on the problem. 

From the empathy maps, the stakeholder’s point of view can allow for setting the foundations of the idea stage by developing “How Might We (“HMW”) Statements to launch brainstorming of other ideation sessions of the team. Below are some of the HMW statements that will trigger the development team’s ideas on how they can effectively create an end solution to the users. 

### How Might We (HMW) Statement
- How Might We share the information details of COVID-19 vaccine for public member to view?
- How Might We ensure that COVID-19 vaccine is safe to have to the general public?
- How Might We encourage member of public to have COVID-19 vaccine?
- How Might We provide member of public to easily register on our system for COVID-19 vaccine ticket?
- How Might We facilitate vaccination centre to the public?
- How Might We contact the public who has successfully book for COVID-19 vaccine?
- How Might We make sure that the public are eligible to have COVID-19 vaccine before registration?
- How Might We contact the public to come and receive second vaccination after the first one?
- How Might We label them as vaccinated people after they have two doses of COVID-19 vaccine? Certificate?
