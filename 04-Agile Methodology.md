# Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology has been chosen for the VMS Project as it provides a versatile structure for developing an effective solution that focus on the customers. The Scrum Framework in particular, is centred around continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors. It acknowledges the fact that the team doesn't know everything at the start of the project and will evolve through experience. This means that the team can adapt to changing conditions and re-prioritisation built within the process through the short release cycles ultimately enabling them to constantly learn and improve. This in turn will save large amounts of time, cost, and resources given to the project. 

## Preparation
The first stage of Scrum in the Agile Methodology is setting up the project foundations. These includes the sprint planning, putting together the sprint backlog, and deciding on the scrum roles. 

The scrum roles have been divided accordingly into different roles including the Project Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. The roles were distributed based on the individual's skills and experience to ensure that the work produced is at a high quality. The team took the initiative to be self-organising and adapt to each other to allow for the best outcomes. Furthermore, they will be cross-functional to ensure that each member can work independently in successfully achieving the outcomes. The roles are as follows: 

* Project Owner:
* Scrum Master
* Development Team:

## Product Backlog 
The Project Owner is responsible for the product backlog and has a say in prioritising the user stories, requirements and changes. The Product backlog will contain all necessary requirements to effectively create the VMS and is thus presented at an ordered list. It is important for the Agile Backlog to be well-prioritised as it not only makes the release and iteration planning easier, it demonstrates all the aspects the team intends to spent time on including the work the customer do not see. The user stories will be used for the product backlog as it breaks down the user needs and requirements which ultimately allow the team to create a roadmap for building the system. The list of user stories can be found in the [Week 2 Product Backlog Tab](https://github.com/bryancolin/ISDM-Group-1/blob/week-2/02-Project%20Backlog.md)

## Sprint Planning Meeting
Sprint Planning is an event in Scrum that kicks off the beginning of the sprint. This event is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how the work can be achieved. Sprint is a set period of time where all the work is done and is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team. The planning meeting will involve the scrum master, project owner, and development team who will decide how the produce will proceed and a plan will then be developed for their own use. The backlog is accessed in this meeting and will have user stories split up into sprint as shown in the table below:
