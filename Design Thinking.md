## General Public (Patient) 

### Point of View (POV) Statement
Patients (member of public) who are interested in getting vaccinated need to know whether they need to get vaccinated or not, as there is a lot of misleading information that is being shared and doesn't have any information to book for one.

### Assumptions
- Patients have not receive any COVID-19 vaccine yet either 
- Patients have no knowledge or anything regarding how to get vaccinated

### How Might We (HMW) Statement
- How Might We share the information details of COVID-19 vaccine for public member to view?
- How Might We ensure that COVID-19 vaccine is safe to have to the general public?
- How Might We encourage member of public to have COVID-19 vaccine?
- How Might We provide member of public to easily register on our system for COVID-19 vaccine ticket?
- How Might We facilitate vaccination centre to the public?
- How Might We contact the public who has successfully book for COVID-19 vaccine?
- How Might We make sure that the public are eligible to have COVID-19 vaccine before registration?
