Many advantages will come with the introduction of the proposed vaccine management system. One of the main advantages will be the great improvement in organisation when carrying out the vaccination process. As this entails that the healthcare workers will have to record when a vaccine is given, how many vaccine doses are left as well as who it was given too. This system allows for a much easier and accurate way of recording these points thus ensuring that data is stored accurately. The system will also improve the experience not only for the healthcare workers but for the general public. As the system comes with a feature that allows the public to view information on the vaccines boosting public confidence in the vaccine's safety. Also provides them with an easy application process where the time slotting and confirmation is automated by the system lowering the risks for human error.
